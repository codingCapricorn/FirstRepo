# Hello World Of Machine Learning --> "IRIS Dataset"

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.
